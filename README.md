# Lowson-RDT (Version 1.0)

As estimator of airfoil turbulent inflow noise based on the owner PhD's study.

### Installation
##### Prerequisites
- [Python]
- [PyQt5]
- [MatPlotLib]
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

##### Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/martuscellifaria/Airfoil-Turbulent-Inflow-Noise-Estimator.git
```


##### Start the GUI
```sh
$ python3 lowson_v2.py
```

### How to use
There you'll have the several inputs to calculate turbulent inflow noise such as airfoil geometric aspects, flow conditions and distance from source and receiver. The output is a self updateable plot that estimates the sound spectrum (sound pressure level) along an audible frequency range.
